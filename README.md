## Introduction

The Movie App is a web application that allows users to browse and search for movies. It utilizes a third-party API to fetch movie details, including titles, descriptions, release dates, and ratings. The app is built with React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend.

## Features

- Search for specific movies
- View detailed information about movies
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadmaarij/movie-app.git
cd movie-app
```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended for the backend):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

4. **Install frontend dependencies:**

```bash
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

5. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your API key:

```
MOVIE_API_KEY=your_movie_api_key
```

6. **Run the application:**

- **Backend:**

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

- **Frontend:**

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

2. Browse trending movies on the homepage.
3. Use the search bar to find specific movies by title.
4. Click on a movie to view detailed information.

## API Integration

The application integrates with a third-party movie API to fetch movie data. Ensure you have a valid API key and update the `.env` file in the `server` directory with your key.
